# Draw and Play
The Draw and Play rule, allows or disallows the act of drawing a card when not being able to play a card, then playing the drawed card 
immediately after. In a standard game, this is used by default.

## Examples
If the current top card is a Green 7, and you can't play anything, and you have to draw a card, and draw a Green card, you can play 
that card if you would like, if you play with the Draw and Play Rule, or if you don't, you have to hold it until your next turn.

When you draw a card, you can not play any other card.
