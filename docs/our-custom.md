# Our Custom Special Rules
Along with the other special game rules, we have also come up with our own rules you can play with. 

## Cumulate v2
This game rule is very similar to the Cumulate rule except, you can place Draw 2s on Draw 4s, and 
vice versa.

### Examples
If Player A plays a Draw 2, then Player B plays a Draw 4, then Player C must draw six cards, and 
then Player B would chose the color.  Play would resume with the next player in the direction of 
play after Player C.

If Player A plays a Draw 4, then Player B plays a Draw 2, then Player C must draw six cards, and 
then Player A would still chose the color.  Play would resume with the next player in the direction of 
play after Player C.

You still can continue to stack Draw 2s and Draw 4s how many times you want, but the final person must draw 
that number of cards, even if you have to reshuffle the discard pile into another draw pile.
The same premise above will work with two players, just Player C will be Player A.

## Power of Two
When you play with this game rule, you have to draw what you normally draw, but to the power of two.

### Drawing When You Can't Play
You still draw one card each time no matter if you are playing with or without the Draw Until Match Rule or not.

### Draw 2s and Draw 4s
When Player A plays a Draw 2, then Player B must draw four cards, since two to the power of two is four.

When Player A plays a Draw 4, then Player B must draw 16 cards, since two to the power of two is 16, 
and then Player A will chose the color, and play would resume with the next player in the direction 
of play after Player B.

### Draw 2s and Draw 4s with the Cumulate Rule
When Player A plays a Draw 2, then Player B plays another Draw 2, then Player C must draw 16 cards, since 
four to the power of two is 16. Play would resume with the next player in the direction of play after Player C. 
If Player C had another Draw 2 and played it, then the next player in the direction of play would have to draw 
thirty six cards, since six to the power of two is thirty six. \\ \\

When Player A plays a Draw 4, then Player B plays another Draw 4, then Player C would have to draw 64 cards, 
since 8 to the power of two is 64. If you run out of cards, shuffle the discard pile except for the top card,
and draw the rest. If you are sill out, the player with the highest amount of cards will give the the rest. 
Player B would chose the color, and play would resume in the direction of play after Player C. If Player C had 
another Draw 4 and played it, then the next player in the direction of play would have to draw 144 cards, since 
12 to the power of two is 144. Obviously you can not draw 144 cards, so shuffle the discard pile except for the 
top card, and give the shuffled card to the player who has to draw 144 cards. After this, playing more Draw 4 cards
obviously will not increase the amount of cards to draw.

## Negative Draw Cards
When you play with this game rule, if you play a Draw 2 or a Draw 4, then it will make the opponent lose 2 and 4 cards 
respectivly, making them less useful.

### Examples
If Player A plays a Draw 2, then Player B must place two cards of his or her choice at the bottom of the draw pile. 
Play would resume with the next player in the direction of play after Player B.

If Player A plays a Draw 4, then Player B must place four cards of his or her choice at the bottom of the draw pile, 
and Player A would chose the color.

### Going Out
If Player A plays a Draw 2 on Player B, and when Player B places his two cards at the bottom of the draw pile, and 
he or she has no cards left, then they win.
The same works with Draw 4s.

## Twos
When you play with this game rule, it allows you to place two cards on top of draw two cards, and vice versa.

### Examples
When Player A plays a Green 2, then Player B may play any Draw 2 card.

When Player A plays a Green Draw 2, then Player B draws 2 cards, then Player C can play any Number 2 card.

### Playing with the Cumulate Rule
When Player A plays a Green Draw 2, then Player B plays any 2 numbered card, then Player C would draw 2 cards. Say 
if Player B would play another Draw 2, then Player C would draw 4 cards like normal cumulate.
