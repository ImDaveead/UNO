# Cumulate v2
This game rule is very similar to the Cumulate rule except, you can place Draw 2s on Draw 4s, and 
vice versa.

## Examples
If Player A plays a Draw 2, then Player B plays a Draw 4, then Player C must draw six cards, and 
then Player B would chose the color.  Play would resume with the next player in the direction of 
play after Player C.

If Player A plays a Draw 4, then Player B plays a Draw 2, then Player C must draw six cards, and 
then Player A would still chose the color.  Play would resume with the next player in the direction of 
play after Player C.

You still can continue to stack Draw 2s and Draw 4s how many times you want, but the final person must draw 
that number of cards, even if you have to reshuffle the discard pile into another draw pile.
The same premise above will work with two players, just Player C will be Player A.
