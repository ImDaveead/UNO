# Cumulate (Progressive UNO)
Cumulate, or known as stacking, allows you to stack Draw 2 and Draw 4 cards, making the next player draw more cards. 
In a standard game, this is not used by default.

## Examples
If Player A plays a Draw 2, then Player B plays a Draw 2, then Player C would draw four cards.

If Player A plays a Draw 4, then Player B plays a Draw 4, then Player C would draw eight cards, and Player B would chose the 
color.

## Examples with 2 Players
If Player A plays a Draw 2, then Player B plays a Draw 2, then Player A would draw four cards. You can stack as many Draw 2 cards as you want.

If Player A plays a Draw 4, then Player B plays a Draw 4, then Player A would draw eight cards, and Player B would chose the 
color. You can stack as many Draw 4 cards as you want.
