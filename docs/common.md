# Common Special Rules
## UNO 7-0
UNO 7-0 is a custom game rule allowing players to switch their hands around when player a 7 
card or a 0 card. In a standard game, this is not used by default.

### Playing a 7
If Player A plays a 7 card, then he or she must switch hands with another player.

### Playing a 0
If Player A plays a 0 card, then everyone in the game must switch hands in the direction of play.
For example, if the order of play is A - B - C - A... and if Player A plays a 0 then A must give 
his or her hand to B and B gives to C, and then C to A.

### Playing a 7 with Two Players
If someone plays a 7 with only two players, then both Players A and B switch hands.

### Playing a 0 with Two Players
If someone plays a 0 with only two players, then both Players A and B switch hands.

## Jump In
Jump In is a custom game rule allowing you to place down the same exact card as someone else, even if it
isn't your turn. In a standard game, this is not used by default.

### Examples
If Player A places down a Green 2, and you have another Green 2, you can place it down before the next player 
plays, and then play resumes from you.

This also works with Draw 4 cards and Wilds. When you jump in with a Draw 4, then the player next to in the direction of 
play from you would draw four cards, or if you are playing with the Cumulate Rule, then would draw eight.

### Jump In with Two Players
If you play a Green 2, and you have another Green 2, you can play both at once.

## Cumulate (Progressive UNO)
Cumulate, or known as stacking, allows you to stack Draw 2 and Draw 4 cards, making the next player draw more cards. 
In a standard game, this is not used by default.

### Examples
If Player A plays a Draw 2, then Player B plays a Draw 2, then Player C would draw four cards.

If Player A plays a Draw 4, then Player B plays a Draw 4, then Player C would draw eight cards, and Player B would chose the 
color.

### Examples with 2 Players
If Player A plays a Draw 2, then Player B plays a Draw 2, then Player A would draw four cards. You can stack as many Draw 2 cards as you want.

If Player A plays a Draw 4, then Player B plays a Draw 4, then Player A would draw eight cards, and Player B would chose the 
color. You can stack as many Draw 4 cards as you want.

## Draw and Play
The Draw and Play rule, allows or disallows the act of drawing a card when not being able to play a card, then playing the drawed card 
immediately after. In a standard game, this is used by default.

### Examples
If the current top card is a Green 7, and you can't play anything, and you have to draw a card, and draw a Green card, you can play 
that card if you would like, if you play with the Draw and Play Rule, or if you don't, you have to hold it until your next turn.

When you draw a card, you can not play any other card.

## Draw Until Match (In Combination with Draw and Play)
The Draw Until Match rule, makes a player draw cards until they can play a card from the draw pile. In a standard game, this is not used by default.

### Examples
If you can't play a card on top of the discard pile, you must draw cards until you are able to play a card.

## Force Play
The Force Play rule, allows or disallows the option to play a card. In a standard game, this is not used by default.

### Examples
With force play off, you can chose to play any card at anytime. For example, you can keep a Wild Card until the end of the game, or keep a 
Green 2 until you want to play it. This can add another factor of strategy to the game.

With force play off, you have to play a card if you can. If you have no playable cards, and have a Draw 4, you have to play the Draw 4.
