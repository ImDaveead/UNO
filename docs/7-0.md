# UNO 7-0
UNO 7-0 is a custom game rule allowing players to switch their hands around when player a 7 
card or a 0 card. In a standard game, this is not used by default.

## Playing a 7
If Player A plays a 7 card, then he or she must switch hands with another player.

## Playing a 0
If Player A plays a 0 card, then everyone in the game must switch hands in the direction of play.
For example, if the order of play is A - B - C - A... and if Player A plays a 0 then A must give 
his or her hand to B and B gives to C, and then C to A.

## Playing a 7 with Two Players
If someone plays a 7 with only two players, then both Players A and B switch hands.

## Playing a 0 with Two Players
If someone plays a 0 with only two players, then both Players A and B switch hands.
