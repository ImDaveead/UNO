# UNO Documentation
Explains everything about the UNO Card game, and many additional ways to play the game. This was originally
a huge latex document, which is now being converted to a documentation-style website.

This documentation is [open-sourced on GitHub](https://github.com/imdaveead/uno-docs) if you would like to make
any changes. A link to edit any page is available at the bottom of that page.
