# Negative Draw Cards
When you play with this game rule, if you play a Draw 2 or a Draw 4, then it will make the opponent lose 2 and 4 cards 
respectivly, making them less useful.

## Examples
If Player A plays a Draw 2, then Player B must place two cards of his or her choice at the bottom of the draw pile. 
Play would resume with the next player in the direction of play after Player B.

If Player A plays a Draw 4, then Player B must place four cards of his or her choice at the bottom of the draw pile, 
and Player A would chose the color.

## Going Out
If Player A plays a Draw 2 on Player B, and when Player B places his two cards at the bottom of the draw pile, and 
he or she has no cards left, then they win.
The same works with Draw 4s.
