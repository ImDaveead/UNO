# Draw Until Match (In Combination with Draw and Play)
The Draw Until Match rule, makes a player draw cards until they can play a card from the draw pile. In a standard game, this is not used by default.

## Examples
If you can't play a card on top of the discard pile, you must draw cards until you are able to play a card.

# Force Play
The Force Play rule, allows or disallows the option to play a card. In a standard game, this is not used by default.

## Examples
With force play off, you can chose to play any card at anytime. For example, you can keep a Wild Card until the end of the game, or keep a 
Green 2 until you want to play it. This can add another factor of strategy to the game.

With force play off, you have to play a card if you can. If you have no playable cards, and have a Draw 4, you have to play the Draw 4.
