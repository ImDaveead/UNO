# Twos
When you play with this game rule, it allows you to place two cards on top of draw two cards, and vice versa.

## Examples
When Player A plays a Green 2, then Player B may play any Draw 2 card.

When Player A plays a Green Draw 2, then Player B draws 2 cards, then Player C can play any Number 2 card.

## Playing with the Cumulate Rule
When Player A plays a Green Draw 2, then Player B plays any 2 numbered card, then Player C would draw 2 cards. Say 
if Player B would play another Draw 2, then Player C would draw 4 cards like normal cumulate.
