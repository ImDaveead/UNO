# Power of Two
When you play with this game rule, you have to draw what you normally draw, but to the power of two.

## Drawing When You Can't Play
You still draw one card each time no matter if you are playing with or without the Draw Until Match Rule or not.

## Draw 2s and Draw 4s
When Player A plays a Draw 2, then Player B must draw four cards, since two to the power of two is four.

When Player A plays a Draw 4, then Player B must draw 16 cards, since two to the power of two is 16, 
and then Player A will chose the color, and play would resume with the next player in the direction 
of play after Player B.

## Draw 2s and Draw 4s with the Cumulate Rule
When Player A plays a Draw 2, then Player B plays another Draw 2, then Player C must draw 16 cards, since 
four to the power of two is 16. Play would resume with the next player in the direction of play after Player C. 
If Player C had another Draw 2 and played it, then the next player in the direction of play would have to draw 
thirty six cards, since six to the power of two is thirty six. \\ \\

When Player A plays a Draw 4, then Player B plays another Draw 4, then Player C would have to draw 64 cards, 
since 8 to the power of two is 64. If you run out of cards, shuffle the discard pile except for the top card,
and draw the rest. If you are sill out, the player with the highest amount of cards will give the the rest. 
Player B would chose the color, and play would resume in the direction of play after Player C. If Player C had 
another Draw 4 and played it, then the next player in the direction of play would have to draw 144 cards, since 
12 to the power of two is 144. Obviously you can not draw 144 cards, so shuffle the discard pile except for the 
top card, and give the shuffled card to the player who has to draw 144 cards. After this, playing more Draw 4 cards
obviously will not increase the amount of cards to draw.
