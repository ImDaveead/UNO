# Playing with a Standard Card Deck
If you decide not to, or you don't have an UNO deck, you can play with a regular deck of playing 
cards with a few minor rules and adjustments. 

## How to Play
To compensate for not having custom cards, Jokers become Wild Cards, the King becomes a Draw 4, the 
Queen becomes a Skip, the Jack becomes a Reverse, and the 10 becomes a Draw 2. If you are playing 
with the UNO 7-0 rule, then the Ace will have the same effect as the 0 card.

## Balancing the Game
If you want the same amount of cards as a standard UNO deck, then you will need 2 sets of cards, 
preferably the same color and brand, so you can't tell the difference, and something to hold all 
the cards in, because a regular card deck case will not hold all the cards. \\ \\

To make this deck, you will need 4 Jokers, 4 Kings of any suit, 8 Queens with 2 from each suit, 
8 Jacks with 2 from each suit, 8 Jacks with 2 from each suit, 8 10 Cards with 2 from each suit, 
and 8 of each of the 1 through 9 cards with 2 from each suit. You will be missing the 0s from the 
deck, but you can make your own by writing an another spare cards.
