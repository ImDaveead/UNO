# Full Deck UNO
Full Deck UNO is where you have to deal the whole deck evenly (or close to it) to all the players.

## Basic Rules
- When drawing cards, draw from the player with the most cards.
- If everyone is at one card, and somebody has to draw, draw from the bottom of the discard pile.
- If somebody Draw 4s or Draw 2s someone, and the player with the most cards doesn't have enough cards, or if the person with the most cards is tied with another person for the same amount of cards, draw from the bottom of the discard pile.

## Extension: Exactly Zero
With this optional rule, **you must** play the last card in your hand. This means nobody else can play a Draw 4 or a Draw 2 and take that card away, instead that person must draw from the bottom of the deck. **You must play it.**
