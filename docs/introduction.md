In this document we will refer to different things as different words.

- **Special Rules / Game Rules** A rule that you can or can not play with in any given UNO game.
- **Game Modes**  Modes you have to play with that change a lot of the gameplay from a normal game
- **Direction of Play** The direction in which players are playing. For example `A - B - C - A` or `A - C - B - A.`

## What is UNO?
UNO is a card game where, players race to empty their hands and catch opposing players with cards left in 
theirs, which score points. In turns, players attempt to play a card by matching its color, number, or word 
to the topmost card on the discard pile. If unable to play, players draw a card from the draw pile, and if 
still unable to play, they pass their turn. Wild and special cards spice things up a bit. 

## Default Rules
### Starting
Each player is given 7 cards, and one card is flipped over from the top of the deck, and that is the starting 
card. You may not start a Draw 4 Card. The play starts from left of the dealer and rotates clockwise. If the first 
discarded card is a Skip, then the player to the left of the dealer misses a turn. If a reverse is the first discarded 
card, then the dealer plays first, and then the player to the right, and rotates counterclockwise. If a Draw 2 Card is 
played as the first discarded card, then the player to the left of the dealer draws 2 cards and misses a turn. If a Wild 
Card is the first discarded card, then the player to the left of the dealer choses the color, and plays normally starting 
with the player to the left of the dealer. When a Draw 4 is is the first discarded card, you return the card to deck, 
shuffle, and try again.

### On Your Turn
On your turn you must, play a card matching the discard in color, number, or symbol, play a Wild card, or a Wild 
Draw Four card, or draw a card.

### Essential Rules
There a a couple of simple rules you must follow in every game of UNO, unless you decide not to, or a special game rule excludes it.

- A player who draws from the deck must either play or keep that card, and may play no other card from their hand on that turn.
- A player may play a Wild card at any time, even if that player has other playable cards.
- A player may play a Wild Draw Four card only if that player has no cards matching the current color. The player may have 
cards of a different color matching the current number or symbol or a Wild card and still play the Wild Draw Four card.
A player who plays a Wild Draw Four may be challenged by the next player to prove that their hand meets this condition.
- If the entire deck is used during play, the top discard is set aside and the rest of the pile is shuffled to create a new deck. 
Play then proceeds normally.
- It is illegal to trade cards of any sort with another player.
- A player who plays their next-to-last-card must call "Uno" as a warning to the other players. 

### Two Player Game
In a two-player game, the Reverse card acts like a Skip card; when played, the other player misses a turn.

## Penalties
If a player does not call "Uno" before, or while laying down their next-to-last card, and is challenged by saying, "You Didn't Call UNO" 
before the next player in sequence takes a turn, they must draw two cards. If the player is not caught in time, or remembers to call "Uno" 
before being caught, they suffer no penalty. If a player falsely calls "Uno" while having multiple cards in their hand, they must draw two 
cards.

If a player plays a Wild Draw Four card, the following player can challenge its use. The player who used the Wild Draw Four must 
privately show their hand to the challenging player, in order to demonstrate that they had no matching colored cards. If the challenge 
is successful, the challenged player draws four cards instead; if it is wrong, the challenger must draw six cards.

### Scoring
There are two ways of playing, a single round with one winner, or playing multiple rounds, playing up a a certain 
score, usually 500 by adding your score at the end of each match, and whoever reaches the target score, is eliminated 
from the game, and the rest of the players play.

The number cards have a value of their face number, Skips, Reverses, Draw 2s count as 20, and Wilds and Draw 4s count 
as 50. If a player goes out of a Draw 4 or a Draw 2, the next player must draw the cards before counting points.

### Game Rules
Game Rules are essentially rules that you may or may not play with in any given UNO game. In a standard UNO game, a lot of these are not 
used, but in the game you play, you can decide if you want to play with them. It is important everyone playing understands the rule, and knows 
what it does to prevent arguments and disagreements.

## Game Modes
Game Modes is a lot like a "preset" that changes a lot of the gameplay mechanics from a normal game, and most likely have certian rules you have 
to play with. We define a Game Mode as a way to play that heavily impacts the way a game of UNO is played.
For example, in the No U Game Mode that we have created, it has game rules that you have to play with the get the full experience, and have 
changed how some cards work. That is why it also can be used as a game rule, if you decide you want to play with the changed card rules, but with 
out the special rules you have to play with.
