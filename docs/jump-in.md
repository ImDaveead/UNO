# Jump In
Jump In is a custom game rule allowing you to place down the same exact card as someone else, even if it
isn't your turn. In a standard game, this is not used by default.

## Examples
If Player A places down a Green 2, and you have another Green 2, you can place it down before the next player 
plays, and then play resumes from you.

This also works with Draw 4 cards and Wilds. When you jump in with a Draw 4, then the player next to in the direction of 
play from you would draw four cards, or if you are playing with the Cumulate Rule, then would draw eight.

## Jump In with Two Players
If you play a Green 2, and you have another Green 2, you can play both at once.
