# Battle Royale
This rule makes the person with the highest amount of points in card value leave the game. This game rule should only be used if there is **three or more players** in the game.

## Pointage
Use the standard UNO scoring.

The number cards have a value of their face number, Skips, Reverses, and Draw 2s count as 20, and Wilds and Draw 4s count 
as 50.

## Tie Breaker
If two or more players tie for the highest amount of points, then the player with the highest amount of special cards (Draw 2, Draw 4, Skip, Reverses) will be out. If some people are still tied, the player with highest amount of points from number cards is out. If people are still tied, the person with the most cards is out, and if people are still tied, compare ages. Oldest is out.
