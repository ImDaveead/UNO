# No U UNO
No U UNO, is a custom game rule for the UNO card game. It allows you to reverse the 
effects of a Draw 2, Draw 4, and Wild Cards by playing Skips and Reverses, also known 
as, No U Cards. 

You can also play this as a custom game mode by playing with the Cumulate Rule and the Draw 
and Play Rule, the UNO 7-0 Rule. You can optionally switch out the Cumulate Rule with the 
Cumulate v2 Rule, and switch the Draw and Play Rule to Draw Until Match rule for even more 
craziness.

## General Rules
- No U Cards are Skips and Reverses.
- No U Cards "No U" Draw 2s Draw 4s and Wild Cards, reversing the effect to another player.
- You must say, "No U" when you play a No U Card.

## Examples
### Draw 4s and Draw 2s
If Player A plays a Draw 4 on Player B, then Player B No U’s the card with 
a Skip, then the next person in the direction of play (Player C) would draw 
four cards, and Player B would chose a color. Play would resume with the next player 
in the direction of play after Player C. 
If Player B No U'd the Draw 4 with a Reverse, then Player A would draw four cards. 
Play would resume with the next player in the direction of play after Player B.

If Player A plays a Draw 2 on Player B, then Player B No U’s the card with 
a Skip, then the next person in the direction of play (Player C) would draw 2 cards, 
and play would resume with the next player in the direction of play after Player C.
If Player B No U'd the Draw 2 with a Reverse, then Player A would draw two cards. 
Play would resume with the next player in the direction of play after Player B.

You can keep placing No U cards and Draw 2s and Draw 4s to reverse the effect to other 
players until someone has no more No U cards left to play, and that person would draw 
two or four cards.

### Draw 4s with 2 Players
If Player A plays a Draw 4 on Player B, then Player B No U’s the card with 
a skip OR a reverse, then Player A would draw four cards, and Player B would 
chose a color. Play would resume with Player B.

You can keep placing No U cards and Draw 2s and Draw 4s to reverse the effect to other 
players until someone has no more No U cards left to play, and that person would draw 
two or four cards.

### Draw 2s with 2 Players
If Player A plays a Draw 2 on Player B, then Player B No U’s the card with 
a skip OR a reverse, then Player A would draw two cards. Play would resume with 
Player B.

You can keep placing No U cards and Draw 2s and Draw 4s to reverse the effect to other 
players until someone has no more No U cards left to play, and that person would draw 
two or four cards.

### Wild Cards
If Player A plays a wild card, and then anyone could play a No U card, then that person can now
chose the color. Play would resume with the next player in the direction of play after 
the person who changed the color.
Another player could play another No U card, and they would chose the 
color. You may also play another Wild Card to have the same effect. 

### No U Stacking
If Player A plays a Draw 2, then Player B plays a No U Card, then Player C plays 
another No U Card, then Player D would draw two cards.
The same rules apply with Draw 4s, but then Player C would decide the color.

### Playing with the Cumulate Rule
If Player A plays a Draw 4, and Player B plays another Draw 4, then Player C would 
have to draw eight cards, and Player B would chose the color.
Player C could also play a No U Card, but it would not increase the amount of cards 
the next player has to draw. 
The same rules apply with Draw 2s, but witout the color switching.

## Combining With the UNO 7-0 Rule
### Playing a 7
If Player A plays a 7 card causing him or her to change hands with another player, 
the person that Player A wants to switch with (Player B) can play a No U Card
to reverse the effect, therefor not having to switch hands. After this Player A can 
play another No U Card if he or she decides to do so. Either Player A or B can also 
play a 7 card to reverse the effect as well. This can repeat forever until Player A 
or B have no more No U Cards that can be played. The play will resume from the 
original player who played the 7 card.

### Playing a 0
If Player A plays a 0 card causing everyone to switch hands in the direction of play, 
then any player can play a No U Card, or another 0 to reverse the effect again, causing 
no change to anyone’s hands. This can repeat forever until there are no more No U Cards 
that can be played by any player. The play resumes from the original player who played 
the 0 card.

### Other Notes
When someone recieves only one card when switching hands for any reason, then any player 
may challenge UNO. Then that person must draw two cards.
